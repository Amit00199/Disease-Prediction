# Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting diseases based on input symptoms. The model was developed as a part of our project for CSI-Hackathon 8.0, where it served as a crucial component of our mobile application aimed at providing assistive technology for rural healthcare.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the problem statement "Assistive Technology for Rural HealthCare" proposed during CSI-Hackathon 8.0. Rural areas often lack access to advanced healthcare facilities and medical expertise. Our goal was to bridge this gap by developing a mobile application that can predict diseases based on symptoms, helping individuals in rural areas to get preliminary healthcare assistance.

## Model Description

The deep learning model implemented in this repository utilizes a neural network architecture to predict diseases based on symptoms provided as input. The model was trained on a dataset comprising symptoms and corresponding disease labels. The trained model can be used to predict diseases based on input symptoms, providing a preliminary diagnosis for individuals in rural areas.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
- `model/`: Contains the deep learning model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
- `architecture.md`: Describes the architecture of the mobile application and the role of the disease prediction model.
